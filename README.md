# MegaCinema
My first web project for ASP.Net Core Course in SoftUni 02.2020.

This is a simple, basic application for cinema company, that allows users to see information about every projection in every cinema of the company, to view details about the movies and for registered users - to book a ticket by choosing desired seat (row and place) in the cinema hall for the chosen projection.
Users also have information about all of the tickets they have booked for every projection.
It has additional functionalities for users with administration role to create, edit or delete movie to the database and create, edit or delete projections for each available movie in the database, following the required data validation.
Initialy, the seeding methods populate the database with the following models:
User - with role administrator,
Cinema,
Hall,
Movie,
Projection,
Seat.
